  "prompt": "GitHub Pages 'pages build and deployment' jobs sometimes show Cancelled (after ~17s) because a higher-priority build is waiting. As a maintainer, how should I interpret this and what minimal guardrails should I add so contributors are not confused?",
  "claims": [
    "Cancelled runs can be normal when concurrency keeps only the latest deployment.",
    "CI signals should minimize contributor confusion and avoid blocking merges on non-failures.",
    "Prefer small, reversible changes: document behavior and adjust required checks before reworking the pipeline."
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "At least one later Pages run completes successfully for the same branch.",
    "We control repository settings and workflow configuration.",
    "We want to keep GitHub Pages deployment lightweight."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Is any branch protection requiring the cancelled check run to pass?",
    "Do we need to disable 'cancel-in-progress' or just document it?",
    "Should we trigger Pages builds only on push to main, or also on manual dispatch?"
